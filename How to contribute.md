# How to contribute

•	Create a standard wit.ai template: Create an app, create good working understanding only for the standard intents, which are delivered with the download and export it in settings-> Export Your Data. Then the first user can import this template in his app (create from backup) and does not have to create all the understandings by himself.

•	Create good function-modules, which are a good use for everybody using the F.R.I.D.A.Y Framework, like returning the weather of a place, mentioned by the user and extracted as a entity, telling the news, etc.. It’s desirable that the functions work on all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) but you can also create platform specific ones and mark them, e.g. news_windows.py.

•	Improve the code: Make the code better, clearer. Turn everything into high quality, nice code!

•	Make architecture improvements: It’s planned to turn F.R.I.D.A.Y into a server, which can receive commands over your Java Android App, Windows C# WPF Software or whatever. You could make a better command-executing system, a better answer system (multiple answers...) or your suggestion of making the F.R.I.D.A.Y more powerful than ever! Please write a Pull Request for your suggestion and explain it!

•	Write a powerful documentation, improve it

•	Improve the GitHub page: more examples, fix mistakes, etc...

•	Create a cool Logo,..
