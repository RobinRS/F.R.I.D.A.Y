# F.R.I.D.A.Y
F.R.I.D.A.Y is a virtual assistant, which understands your commands via AI NLP (natural language processing), used by wit.ai.

The power of F.R.I.D.A.Y for a developer is the flexibility: Altough the standard name is Friday, you can choose your own. You are able to create your very own functions with python scripts, for example control your water irrigation system just with your command, which is, where many other assistants have their weakness, not an hardcoded if-statement (if weather in user input). No, the user input is processed by the powerful AI natural language processing framwork wit.ai (pywit), which is some of the greatest feature of F.R.I.D.A.Y.

F.R.I.D.A.Y is very easy to used, and is there to be extended my you. It's the key feature that you write your own function-modules, make it a server or combine it with your mobile Speech-To-Text App on your phone.
